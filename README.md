Hello, my name is Kau√£ and I have been a developer since 2015, which means I have been in this field for 8 years. I work in areas such as games, artificial intelligence, and libraries.

I am a self-taught Brazilian freelance developer who loves to learn and explore the various resources available on the internet. I also enjoy teaching and helping other developers, which led me to create my own game development course.

In 2014, due to my passion for games, I started exploring the world of development. I learned how games work and what could be the first steps to developing my own game. However, it wasn't until 2015 that I started to learn a little more about development and became acquainted with programming. I studied some languages, including Java and logical languages.

From 2017, I started a more in-depth study of programming, which led me to learn my favorite programming languages, which are JavaScript (NodeJS), in which I worked extensively on developing AIs, and Lua (Luau), which I use to develop games on the Roblox platform. In the meantime, I also learned a little bit about other languages, such as Ladder, Delphi, and CSharp.

As expected, I joined the Roblox platform in 2017, but without many goals beyond entertainment. This changed in 2019 when I started working on some small projects, which served as great support for my knowledge about programming. Additionally, I started learning a bit more about other languages, such as Python and C++, improving my knowledge about logic and bringing more visibility to my work.

Currently, I am developing my own projects and doing some commissions to cover my expenses, but I will always be available and willing to help, if needed!
