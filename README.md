Hello, I'm Kau√£, Brazilian developer and enthusiast since 2016! I work on many features such as games, artificial intelligences and libraries!

 I'm a self-taught developer who loves to learn and explore the most varied resources available on the Internet. I also really enjoy teaching and helping other developers so that everyone can evolve together!

 I started working as a developer in 2016 with a few programming languages including Ladder, Java and Javascript. From 2017 I entered the Roblox platform which was like a trigger for my enthusiasm for programming, so I started to learn the Lua language, CSharp and NodeJS. After a long period on the Roblox platform, in 2019 I decided to expand my programming knowledge by creating various bots for Discord and also studying other languages, including Python and C++ in which I didn't have many projects and in the end I returned to the Roblox platform which, in 2020, I also started to learn other areas of development, such as 3D modeling and graphic design.
